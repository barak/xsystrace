Description: Systrace frontend invoked by systrace
 Systrace enforces system call policies for applications by
 constraining the application's access to the system. The
 policy is generated interactively. Operations not covered
 by the policy raise an alarm and allow an user to refine the
 currently configured policy.
 .
 This program will be execute if systrace runs in interactive
 mode and create the rules based on the inputs and selections
 in this frontend. It is also a gui to help creating permit or
 deny rules for systrace templates.
